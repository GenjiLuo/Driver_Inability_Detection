# Driver_Inability_Detection
This project aims to reduce the number of accidents that occur because of drivers dozing off and losing control over the vehicle using real time image processing.

The notebook uploaded contains function to identify the user by processing his image and comparing it against a database of stored imaged and creates a new entry otherwise.
